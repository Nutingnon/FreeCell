# FreeCell
To create a project that emulate the classic solitaire -- FreeCell
The language is using Python. And it is a non-GUI interface.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project imitates the famous solitaire game: Free Cell. The project contains 4 classes: Card, Board, Deck and FreeCell. As their names imply, the class representing the corresponding concept has powerful and separate function. Consequently, the combination of those class comes into the good game: FreeCell.
The structure is : 
Deck&Board form the FreeCell, the deck is made up of Card.

The operation is easy to understand, and the interface is nice.

Moreover, I add a function which is highly similar to the FreeCellâ€”automatically collect the cards from cascades once they are qualified. The condition is that each foundation should contain at least one card, then the automatic collection function could be activated. Once the user chooses the e -- automatically move valid cards from cascades to open foundation, the system will detect whether there is a card in cascades could be put into foundation, if yes, it would automatically put the card into foundation at proper position, if not, it would give the information telling the user there is no card could be automatically collected.
